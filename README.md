## üìã About the project

The Neumorphic Calculator App is a Dart and Flutter-based application that provides a **user-friendly calculator interface** with a visually pleasing **neumorphic design**. The app follows the [Eva Design System](https://colors.eva.design/), predominantly utilizing shades of purple, black, and white to create a sleek and modern aesthetic.

## üöÄ Getting started

To get started with the Neumorphic Calculator App, **follow these steps**:

1. Clone the project repository.
    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andreaaazo/neumorphic-calculator.git
   ```
2. Ensure you have **Dart and Flutter** installed on your development environment.
3. Open the project in your preferred **IDE**.
4. Run the **`main.dart`** file or use the following command:
   ```sh
   flutter run
   ```

## üìÅ App Structure & Mechanics

The **project structure** is organized as follows:

```bash
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ calculator.dart
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.dart
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ container.dart
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ text_button.dart
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components.dart
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ colors.dart
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ typography.dart
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.dart
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ui.dart
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ widgets
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ calculator_display.dart
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ calculator_processor.dart
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ calculator_second_display.dart
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ calculator_tab.dart
```

* `calculator.dart` and `main.dart` serve as the **entry points** to the application.
* The `src` directory contains the **user interface-related code**, including design elements, colors, and typography.
* Within `src`, the `components` folder houses the **Design System components**, such as `text_button.dart` and `container.dart`.
* The styles directory within `src` contains `colors.dart`, managing the **app's color palette** based on the [Eva Design System](https://colors.eva.design/), and `typography.dart`, defining the **app's text styles**.
* `components.dart` and `styles.dart` serve as import files to make UI elements accessible throughout the project.
* The `widgets` folder comprises **custom components** used in the app, such as `calculator_display.dart`, `calculator_processor.dart`, `calculator_second_display.dart`, and `calculator_tab.dart`.

The application's logic is separated from the UI, following the **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) and **SOLID** programming principles. The **core logic** resides in `calculator_processor.dart`, which is an abstract class. Data from the `calculator_tab.dart` is passed to `calculator_processor.dart` through a class function, where it is stored in a private variable. **The processor then performs the necessary calculations**.

Here is a diagram illustrating the **data flow** and **handling**:
```mermaid
graph TD
  A[calculator_tab.dart] -->|Passes data to| B[calculator_processor.dart]
  B --> C{Private Variable}
  C -->|Calculations| C
  C -->|Result Stream| D[calculator_display.dart]
  C -->|Expression Stream| E[calculator_second_display.dart]
```

**To update the UI** with the result and expression, the `calculator_processor.dart` abstract class utilizes **two Streams**. These streams **send the result and expression to** the `calculator_display.dart` and `calculator_second_display.dart` components, respectively, both of which are **listening to the streams**. This allows for **real-time updates** of the displayed data based on the calculations performed by the processor.

## üé® UI Case Study

<img src="screenshots/screenshot.png" width="50%"></img>

The Neumorphic Calculator App showcases a **neumorphic user interface design**, which provides an elegant and tactile user experience. The app adheres to the [Eva Design System](https://colors.eva.design/), utilizing a harmonious combination of **purple, black, and white** colors to create a visually appealing interface.

The **Design System components**, including `text_button.dart` and `container.dart`, are carefully crafted to ensure **consistency and reusability** throughout the app. The `colors.dart` file in the styles folder defines the **color palette**, while `typography.dart` handles the **typography choices**, ensuring clear and legible text.

The UI reflects the principles of neumorphism, with subtle shadows and soft edges on interactive elements, resulting in a **modern and visually engaging calculator experience**.
